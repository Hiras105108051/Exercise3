            <h1>Televisions Energy Consumption</h1>
            <p>Televisions have become an integral part of Australian households, providing entertainment and information.

                However, their energy consumption can vary significantly depending on factors like screen size, technology, and usage patterns. 
                This page aims to provide insights into television energy consumption in Australia, helping you make informed choices and reduce your carbon footprint..</p>


            <p>Television energy consumption varies significantly based on screen technology, size, and settings. Modern OLED and LED TVs are generally more efficient than older models, but larger screens and higher brightness levels increase power usage. Energy rating labels, like Energy Star or EU Energy Labels, provide valuable information for comparing models. 
                To minimize consumption, choose energy-efficient TVs, adjust settings, and unplug the device when not in use.</p>
