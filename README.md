--------------------------------- Data Story ------------------------------------------------

Targeting a wide range of people, including individual homes, energy providers, policymakers, and researchers, this data story examines television energy use in Australia. It seeks to give the audience useful information by displaying trends of energy use, affecting elements like TV kind and screen size, and possible savings. These are some common questions audience is curious about.

                 1. How much energy do televisions consume in Australian households?
                 2. How do factors like screen size, TV type (LCD, OLED), and usage patterns affect energy consumption?
                 3. What are the potential savings from adopting energy-efficient televisions or changing viewing habits?
                 4. Are there significant differences in energy consumption based on location or household size?

The data, which comes from industry specifications, government reports, and surveys, is subjected to strict processing to guarantee accuracy and preserve privacy by anonymization. The accuracy of the visualization is dependent on the reliability of the source data and Energy consumption estimates may not accurately represent the behavior of individual households because they are based on average usage patterns. Although limitations exist due to averaged usage and evolving technology, the goal of the visualization is to raise awareness of environmental issues and encourage appropriate energy use by presenting objective, unbiased information.
